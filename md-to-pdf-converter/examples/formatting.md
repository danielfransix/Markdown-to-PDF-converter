# Text Formatting Examples

This document demonstrates various text formatting options available in Markdown and how they appear in PDF output.

## Basic Text Formatting

### Emphasis

- *This text is italic* (using single asterisks)
- _This text is also italic_ (using underscores)
- **This text is bold** (using double asterisks)
- __This text is also bold__ (using double underscores)
- ***This text is bold and italic*** (using triple asterisks)
- ~~This text is strikethrough~~ (using double tildes)

### Inline Code

Use `backticks` to create inline code. For example: `print("Hello, World!")` or `const x = 42;`.

### Superscript and Subscript

- E = mc² (superscript example)
- H₂O (subscript example)
- x^2^ + y^2^ = z^2^
- CO~2~ emissions

## Headings Hierarchy

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## Special Characters and Symbols

### Common Symbols

- Copyright: © 
- Trademark: ™
- Registered: ®
- Arrows: → ← ↑ ↓ ↔
- Math: ± × ÷ ≠ ≤ ≥ ∞
- Currency: $ € £ ¥ ₹
- Quotes: "Smart quotes" and 'single quotes'

### Escape Characters

Sometimes you need to escape special characters:

- \*This is not italic\*
- \#This is not a heading
- \`This is not code\`
- \[This is not a link\]

## Text Alignment and Spacing

### Normal Paragraph

This is a normal paragraph with standard alignment. It flows naturally and wraps according to the page width.

### Line Breaks

This line has a manual break  
and continues on the next line.

You can also use two spaces at the end of a line  
to create a line break without starting a new paragraph.

### Preformatted Text

    This text is preformatted
    It maintains    spacing
    And line breaks exactly
    As written in the source

## Combinations

### Mixed Formatting

You can combine different formatting options:

- **Bold with *italic* inside**
- *Italic with **bold** inside*
- `Code with **bold** text` (bold doesn't work inside code)
- ~~Strikethrough with **bold** text~~

### Complex Examples

1. **Important**: Always use `const` instead of `var` in modern JavaScript
2. *Note*: The function `calculateTotal()` returns a **number**
3. ~~Deprecated~~: The old `XMLHttpRequest` API is being replaced by `fetch()`

## Special Markdown Extensions

### Abbreviations

*[HTML]: HyperText Markup Language
*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets
*[JS]: JavaScript

HTML and CSS are fundamental web technologies. JS adds interactivity.

### Definition Lists

:   Definition for term 1
